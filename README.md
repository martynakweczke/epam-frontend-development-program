# Running the app

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Install dependencies**

    Run the following command to install all required packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Compile SASS and start the project**

    After installing the dependencies, run:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command will compile all .scss files into .css, place them inside the dist folder and launch the project in your local environment.
