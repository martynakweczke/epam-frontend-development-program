# Running the app

To run the project locally, follow these steps:
 
 1. **Install dependencies**
      
    Run the following command to install all required packages: 

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

 2. **Compile SASS and start the project**
    
    After installing the dependencies, run: 

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command will compile all .scss files into .css, place them inside the dist folder and launch the project in your local environment.
